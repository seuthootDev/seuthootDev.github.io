# GPT 선생님의 첨삭

Seunghoon has two job interviews this week, so he is preparing for them.  
He goes to the study cafe almost every day except on the day he has an English lesson.  
He thinks his current job is actually not that great because the project he is working on has a relatively simple structure.  
He wants to move to a bigger company than his current one, which is why he is looking for a new job.  
So, when is his job interview? It's today—he already went to one.  
He took the subway to get there, which took about two hours. (And he lied to his boss, saying, "I have to go to the dentist today, so I will leave after lunch.")  
He came back home, had dinner, and wrote about what happened today.

**1.** 수 숫자: "2"를 "two"로 표기하는 것이 일반적인 영작 규칙입니다.
**2.** 문장 간 연결: 몇 군데 문장을 자연스럽게 연결하고, 불필요한 반복을 줄였습니다.
**3.** 불완전한 문장 수정: 예를 들어, "he go to study cafe"를 "He goes to the study cafe"로 바꾸었습니다.
**4.** "for go there" 수정: "for go there"는 부자연스럽고 "to get there" 또는 "to go there"로 바꾸는 것이 더 자연스러워요.
