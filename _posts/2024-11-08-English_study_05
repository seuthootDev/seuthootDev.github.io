Hi, I’m going to say my experience about two job interviews that I had this week.

Hm, what should I say first? The first company I visit for interview was about Metaverse, virtual reality, smart 관제 services for business of a lot of fields.

Well, I’m using a 3D visualization tool KIP for my project of current company.

So of course I have some knowledge about 3D environment.

That’s why I applied to the company that suggested me an interview.

Metaverse, virtual reality, smart 관제 services need knowledge about 3D environment I think.

anyways,
