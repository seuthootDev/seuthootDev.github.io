Hi, I’m going to say my experience about two job interviews that I had this week.


## Job Interview 1
Hm, what should I say first? The first company I visit for interview provides Metaverse, virtual reality, smart 관제 services  for business of a lot of fields.

Well, I’m using a 3D visualization tool kip for my project of current company.

Of course I have some knowledge about 3D environment.

That’s why I applied to the company that suggested me an interview.

Services the company provides need knowledge about 3D environment I think

Anyways, thursday was the d-day there were three interviewer and me 

A woman right of them asked me some questions about my personality

It was not bad actually i answerd well, im pretty good speaker

A man of right them -i think he is a programmer- asked me about tech

that was a bit funny but i felt im really bad cuz one of his question was that

"you got a lot of certification in this year, you are junier programmer right?

and then, your project now you do is very easy?"

now i guess he wanted me to answer like

"No, i was busy and im working hard everyday but i made a time and studied for my carrer"

but my answer was 

"yes im not busy as you say, that why i want to move to my work"

i guess he was flustered

it was a bit funny but actually i felt bad cuz im not developing me in my company now

he also gave me another questions about tech and i answerd but my experience was not enough

i have to do something to my career

and the man center of them was CEO i think

he asked me all kind of questions i dont remember what were those but it was not difficult

it was like about my philosophy?

i throght two kind of idae after this interview

first, when they asked me my personality, maybe i answered not about me

that was what i want to be (hope you can get it)

so its a bit presure for me if i will work on there

second idea was 


## Job Interview 2

D-day for second interview was today. i visit the company today morning

Hmmm, this company is about medical thing. they have a program for surgery

its like a navigation for surgery -i got it when im going to this company in the morning i throught im dead- CT data is 2D data. so they have to transform this to 3D data and render this on display. this part actualy simillar what im doing in my company i think
