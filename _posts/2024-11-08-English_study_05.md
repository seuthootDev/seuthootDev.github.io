Hi, I’m going to say my experience about two job interviews that I had this week.


## Job Interview 1

Hm, what should I say first? The first company I visit for interview provides Metaverse, virtual reality, smart monitoring services  for business of a lot of fields.

Well, I’m using a 3D visualization tool kip for my project of current company. of course I have some knowledge about 3D environment. that’s why I applied to the company that suggested me an interview. services the company provides need knowledge about 3D environment I think

Anyways, thursday was the d-day there were three interviewer and me 

A woman right of them asked me some questions about my personality

It was not bad actually i answerd well, im pretty good speaker

A man of right them -i think he is a programmer- asked me about tech

That was a bit funny but i felt im really bad cuz one of his question was that "you got a lot of certification in this year, you are junier programmer right? And then, your project now you do is very easy?"

Now i guess he wanted me to answer like "No, i was busy and im working hard everyday but i made a time and studied for my carrer" but my answer was "yes im not busy as you say, that why i want to move to my work"

I guess he was flustered. it was a bit funny but actually i felt bad cuz im not developing me in my company now

He also gave me another questions about tech and i answerd but my experience was not enough

I have to do something to my career

And the man center of them was CEO i think. he asked me all kind of questions i dont remember what were those but it was not difficult. it was like about my philosophy?

I thought two kind of idae after this interview

First, when they asked me about my personality, maybe i answered not about me. that was what i want to be (hope you can get it). so its a bit presure for me if i will work on there

Second idea was, what im doing at my current company is not going to help my career. so i have to move it


## Job Interview 2

D-day for second interview was today. i visit the company today morning

Hmmm, this company is about medical thing. they have a program for surgery

its like a navigation for surgery -i got it when im going to this company in the morning i throught im dead- CT data is 2D data. so they have to transform this into 3D data and render it on display. this part actualy similar what im doing at my company i think

there were two interviewers. i introduced my self and explained what i think about this company.

After that, i had a presentation with my portfolio. i didnt expected this

Before the interview, i thought like "maybe i have to explain my portfolio, what i did and what im doing now"

But i prepared simple answers like "i used that skill to implement this facility"-presentation wasnt what i expecte

Anyways, i had to do that so i did, my portfolio is about 3D environment. wow it was really hard to explian

I had should prepared presentation. that was my mistake

My presentation took a more than 40 minutes. they asked a lot about what i did

It was hard to me but actally not that much cuz i didnt lie at all. every things in my portfolio are that i really did

One of them ask me after my presentation "did you do anything funny in your workplace"?

And i said "yes i did. that was transforming SLAB code from Fortran to Python. it was a big chellange for me and made my CS knowledge better. i throught my logic has no problem but the results were diffirent and i figured out it. there are Single Precision and Double Precision.
Fortran's variables are Double Precision but Python's are Single Precision so it made the diffirence"

He said he impressed this exprience of mine


## My thoughts after the interviews

First, i have a problem. i used my half-vacations to take a interviews. but i the company i visited today has second interview. i have to use one more my half-vacation but maybe it make my boss to doubt me lol. actually i think he is already doubting me

Second, what should i choose? actually when i visited first company, i think like "this one is good. it can make me to get better career" and when i visited second one, "wow i like it, i want to work on it"

Maybe next week, the first company will contact me. i will know whether i got it or not.
if i got this, i have to choose cuz i didnt take a second interview of second company

I have no idea
