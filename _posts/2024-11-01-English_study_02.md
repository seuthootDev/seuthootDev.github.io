Mistake #1
Technical Debt. Over-engineering. Does that ring a bell? Often, developers shift their focus to the technical side rather than understanding how the user will utilize the application. Based on those requirements, they don’t write their code. If back-end engineers used technologies based on the requirements, they would significantly reduce the required effort and cost.

Mostly, beginners fall for this mistake. As they are new in the field, they don’t know what technologies will serve efficiently for the user while reducing the technical burden. The application becomes slow for the end user when more technologies and processing are required.

New people in any field, hobby, or habit tend to overcomplicate the process. However, seniors reduce the effort and cost while using fewer technologies to save development and user time.

Furthermore, Technical Debt indicates non-readable code. Write logic that other engineers can understand is the first rule of development. It means using industry-standard techniques and coding standards, such as this one, or writing variables in the CamalCase convention.

Beginners feel a sense of pride when they use everything they possibly can. Later, the same choices become a headache when they make the application slower. It requires seniors to refactor the code, and that is a waste of time. The testing requirements and the chances of bugs increase with more code. Write less code.

Avoid this mistake by keeping pride aside and choosing only the necessary technologies with the best industry standards. I made this mistake when I started learning front-end frameworks and libraries. It resulted in more code, more bugs, and massive refactoring costs. Follow the DRY, KISS, or YAGNI standards.
