Hello, I am Seunghoon Jung. I am a startup developer with diverse software development experience, currently exploring new opportunities.

I am interested in programming language theory and implementation, and I am a creative technologist who values various humanistic aspects such as visual, auditory, and interactive elements in UI and HCI.

Previously, I have worked in various roles on multiple projects and have continually explored new technology trends and development methodologies.

I studied Mathematics at Yonsei University, where I built a strong foundation in mathematical knowledge.
